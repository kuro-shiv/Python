    "sen =\"A paragraph is a group of sentences that are related to a central idea or topic. It typically begins with a topic sentence that introduces the main point, followed by supporting sentences that elaborate on or explain the idea. Each sentence in the paragraph is connected to the others, forming a coherent unit of thought. A well-written paragraph usually ends with a concluding sentence, summarizing the key point or transitioning to the next paragraph. Good paragraphs are clear, focused, and concise, and they help the reader understand and follow the writerâ€™s ideas.\"\n",
